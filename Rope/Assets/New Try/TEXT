Rope Physics Testing Document

Objectives:
	Rope should be dynamic, meaning points should be created when needed, 
	with a minimum standard resolution (maximum distance before creating a new point)

	If an object enters into contact with the rope, a new point will be created as a flexing point
	meaning that next points will be created from there. However, these new points will not move furhter points but stay at a relative position.

	A segment, therefore, can have any number splits, and those splits are at a certain factor of the segment. 

	A segment will take into account internal splits to make the simulation, creating new ones, removing others.

	A segment has an internal show function, and simulate function, within it holds each of the internal steps.

	For the application of forces, it will store the previous state of the rope, simulate each of the points, and then, calculate from the previous to the new one. 
	An option is doing it twice, the first one for the forces, the second for the collision.

	An other is doing all the calculation, and storing the removed part of each point on collision detection, maybe creating a vector that contains the amount removed in total and 
	therefore, force applied.

Structure:

	A rope contains segments, starting point and ending point
	A segment contains a starting point, an ending point, and internal points
	A point contains a position, a previous position vector, a stored force vector
